-> create a map that keeps track of a value and it's index
-> in a singular for loop, calculate the compliment of the two sum target
-> if there's the compliment in the map, then return the current iteration index of the for loop and the index of the compliment from the map
-> for example, if our target is 9, and the current number we're examining at nums[i] is 2, then we're looking for the index of 7 in the map
