- process the most frequent character first
- there is no native maxHeap in python so flip the sign of the integers that we push to the maxHeap
- use an auxiliary and parallel queue to keep track of what's left to process and when it can be processed. this can be processed as a tuple
- the time-to-process is the current time plus the cooldown time
